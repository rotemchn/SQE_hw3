## What we tested

We tested the cart module, in which a client can add products to his cart, see their prices, and purchase them.

We chose to test the following user stories: 

*User story:* A client adds a review to a product.

*Preconditions:* There is a store with a product.

*Expected outcome:*  The a review is added to the product.

*User story:* A seller deletes the product.

*Preconditions:* There is a store with a product, and the seller has permission to delete the product.

*Expected outcome:*  The product was deleted.


## How we tested
We used two different testing methods:
1. [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/), a BDD testing framework.
2. [Provengo](https://provengo.tech/), a story-based testing framework.

Each of the testing methods is elaborated in its own directory. 

## Results
Update all README.md files (except for d-e, see Section 1). Specifically, replace all $$*TODO*â€¦$$ according to the instructions inside the $$.
